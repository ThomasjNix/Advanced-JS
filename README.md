# Advanced-JS
I created this little repo as a way for me to keep track of some of the JS topics I'm learning about on my way to being a JavaScript Ninja.
The code examples I have are explained in case I need them for reference, or if I want to explain anything to colleagues. It is still very early and there is 
so much to learn, but I'm looking forward!

A huge thanks to TechSmith on YouTube, as of right now most of the information is coming from his channel. 

Here is a running list of resources I am picking up information from:
